# Minimal requirements for running unit tests and component utilities locally.
# Note: The QuantConnect runtime (AlgorithmImports) is not available via pip.
# To run tests locally you'll need lightweight shims/mocks for QuantConnect APIs
# or run tests inside the QuantConnect environment.

# Numerical and testing libraries
numpy>=1.25
pytest>=7.0

# Optional (only if you add tests or use dataframes locally)
# pandas>=2.2
